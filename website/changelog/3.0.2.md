**General**
* Typing the first few characters of an item to jump to it in lists has been re-implemented
* Dumped Audiere as the sound/midi library in windows, and swapped to SFML-audio. Upsides are much better/faster audio support and audio support in linux (and mac). Downsides are no mp3 or module format support (though I'll look into adding these back at a later date)
* Fluidsynth is now used to preview MIDI in both windows and linux
* Many other bugfixes and small improvements

**Resource Editor**
* New 'Graphic' menu for gfx entries, with some basic gfx editing functions:
  * Flip/Mirror
  * Rotate
  * Colourise
  * Colour Translate
* Added the ability to open entries in separate tabs
* Added 'Texture' menu when a texture editor is open
* Palettes can now be exported in various formats: raw, png image, csv and jasc palette

**Texture Editor**
* Texture editor now supports ZDoom's enhanced TEXTURES format
* Added ability to copy+paste textures from one TEXTUREx list to another
* Added shortcut keys and context menu for the texture list
