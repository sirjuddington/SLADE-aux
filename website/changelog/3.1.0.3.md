**General**
* New custom tab and docked panel style, should no longer have redrawing issues around the edges
* Removed option for tab style (the above change removes the need for it - and the other default wxwidgets tab styles were ugly anyway)
* Fixed various issues with detection of changes to a directory that is open as an archive
* Fixed an issue where having double quotes in a cvar could corrupt the configuration file
* Fixed an issue on OSX where the splash window would not disappear

**Resource  Editor**
* Module music playback now works again
* Re-enabled the file browser tab in the archive manager, can be disabled in preferences if it still causes issues
* Fixed possible crash on 'Remove Unused Textures'

**Map Editor**
* Use the most advanced available map format by default when creating a new map (or the format of the first existing map in the archive)
* Moving a line over an existing vertex will now split the line
* Fixed an issue that could cause a lockup after moving lines to overlap
