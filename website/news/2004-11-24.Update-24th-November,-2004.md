SLADE v0.11 is now available for download. The only real new feature is a 3d preview mode. It's not complete yet, I still have to get it rendering 2-sided middle textures (bars, etc), and I have to figure out how the bsp tree works so it doesn't have to render the whole map constantly :P. I've also started on some preliminary Hexen format support: SLADE will now load up Hexen-format maps correctly, as long as you use the right config file (z_doom2 and z_doom1 for now). Anyway hopefully soon I'll have full ZDoomHexen support done...
