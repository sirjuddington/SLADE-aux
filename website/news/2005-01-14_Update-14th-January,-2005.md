Heh, a month has passed and still no release. Basically I ran into the boring parts to code, and now with a holidays/girlfriend/job combo I don't really have much time to work on it. But a few days ago I managed to make a bit of progress, and all that I really need to do now is the texture browser, sector creation and finish off the menus. So I'm hoping to release a new version sometime late January or early February.
