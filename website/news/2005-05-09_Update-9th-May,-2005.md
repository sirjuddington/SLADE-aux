Whee, SLADE v0.4 is here! Whats new, you ask? Why, this:

    -> Editing in 3d mode
    -> Thing sprites in 2d and 3d modes
    -> ZDoom maps support (minus generalized sector types, for now)
    -> Now reads textures from ZDoom TX_ markers (PNG and Doom Patches)
    -> Mouse can now be used to select menu items
    -> Console in 3d mode (for testing mainly)
    -> Line Drawing
    -> Lots of other stuff

Head over to the download page to get it! And please report any bugs over at the forums. Without that I can't make SLADE any better ;)
Oh, also there's no source release yet. I'll upload that once I clean it up a bit :P
