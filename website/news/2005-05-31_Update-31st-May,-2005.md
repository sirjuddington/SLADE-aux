SLADE 0.5 released! New stuff in this version:

    -> New 'draw rectangle' feature, shift+space by default
    -> Changed how keys.cfg works, now it looks uglier, but I don't have to include it with every SLADE release any more, so you get to keep your controls config when you update SLADE ;)
    -> New 'create stairs' and 'create door' options in the edit menu when in sectors mode
    -> Thing editing in 3d mode (only change angle and z-height for now)
    -> ZDoomGL hires textures support (via HIRESTEX lump)
    -> Different sort modes for the texture browser: 'alphabetical' and 'frequency of use'
    -> Most menu options should work now ;)
    -> 'Change skin' option in the menu. Also there's a new section in slade.cfg to define your own skins
    -> 3 new skins: 'flatish', 'simple' and 'simple2'
    -> Crosshair and mouse pointer now skin-independant (you can specify what crosshair/pointer you want in slade.cfg)
    -> The usual random bugfixes

Also, I've written a simple tutorial for SLADE (creating a 2-rooms-with-door map). Hopefully I'll get around to writing more SLADE tutorials. I'd advise people to read it, because, even though it's simple, it shows off some of the time-saving editing features in SLADE ;)

Lastly, Miffe has set up a SVN for SLADE, which I'll post about when it's up and running properly. Hopefully the 0.5 source I have up will compile in linux, but if not, either patch it up yourself or check the forums about the SVN...
