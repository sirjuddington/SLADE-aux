SLADE 0.6 is released. Here be what is new:

    -> Slopes in 3d mode
    -> Merge/Join sectors (j or ctrl+j by default)
    -> 'Extrude lines' feature.
    -> Smaller zoom increments with + and - keys (mouse scroll for large increments)
    -> Changed handling of non-power-of-two textures. They should tile correctly in 3d mode now. As a side-effect, drivers with OpenGL 2.0 support are now needed to display these textures correctly (if gl_filter isn't set to 3)...

Yup, that's right, slopes support in 3d mode! Before you get too excited I have to mention that it's not complete, but should be fine for most things. For now only line 181 (plane_align) and the 'slope to here' things are processed, and sometimes the walls at the sides of a slope will be missing. The missing textures bug is something I can't really fix unless I rewrite how 3d mode works.

Speaking of rewriting, I've started work on 'Gtk-SLADE', which is SLADE, but using GTK for the user interface. So, v0.6 will be the last SDL/text-ui version of SLADE. I'll post further updates on Gtk-SLADE later, for now it's on hold until MS releases RC1 of Visual Studio 2005. Earlier versions didn't like Gtkmm (which is what I'm using), and so far I've been forced to use Dev-Cpp, which isn't too bad but lacks good debugging, which I am in need of at the moment :P.
