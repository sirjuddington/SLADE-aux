Well since Gtk-SLADE is well on the way I figured I'd better update the site design for it. I'm up to rewriting 3d mode, which will probably take a while, as I'm planning writing it from the ground-up with slopes and 3d floors support in mind (possibly even dynamic lights, who knows :P).

Also I have set up a <A HREF="http://gtkslade.berlios.de" TARGET="_new">BerliOS project page</A> for it, so you can check out the <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/gtkslade/trunk/changelog.txt" TARGET="_new">changelog</A> and/or source via <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/gtkslade/" TARGET="_new">SVN</A>.
