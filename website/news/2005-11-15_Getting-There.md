I've updated the screenshots section with a few new dev screens. In one you can see that the zdoom TranslucentLine special is previewed in 3d mode ;) Most of the 3d mode editing stuff is in, and soon it will be ready for an initial release. All that needs to be done is slopes parsing, texture alignment and a few other small things...
