SLADE v1.01 is here. New stuff here:

    -> Copy+Paste
    -> 3d mode resolution selection
    -> Fixed some problems with slopes in 3d mode
    -> Window properties are now saved
    -> Scroll wheel now works in the 2d editor (zoom in/out)

There are also plenty of bugfixes too. As always, grab it from the downloads section right now :P
