To kick off 2006, here's version 1.02 of SLADE:

    -> Added keys to copy/paste Sidedef data in 3d mode
    -> Texture browser textures can be sorted by usage frequency
    -> Status bar on the editor window
    -> Improvements to line drawing (drawing 'over' vertices now works correctly)
    -> Changed input system to include mouse buttons, so now they are properly configurable
    -> Added keys to increase/decrease sector(s) light level in 2d mode (; and ' by default)
    -> Grid snap is now toggleable
    -> Bugfixes etc

I've actually been sitting on this for a while, just haven't gotten around to releasing it until now. So what's next? I've started porting the GUI over to wxWidgets, which works much better in windows than GTK (and uses GTK in linux :P). From a coding point of view it's much easier to work with since it is written in c++ rather than c. Anyway I'll probably have the first wxWidgets version out sometime in february or march, which will be version 1.1.
