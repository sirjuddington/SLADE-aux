Much sooner than expected, I've released SLADE v1.1. There is no linux source available yet, because I can't boot into linux at the moment to try compiling it. I'm guessing from my previous experience with wxWidgets+Linux, there will be plenty of problems to do with strings (unicode/ascii conversion stuff). Not saying it's impossible to compile in linux though, just it'll take some work as it stands at the moment.

Anyway here's the new stuffage:

    -> Moved UI to wxWidgets, which looks much better in Windows while keeping cross-platform capability
    -> Map preview in the wad manager
    -> Improvements to the args editing UI stuff
    -> Option to scale text messages in 3d mode
    -> Improved hilight lines in 3d mode
    -> Context menus in line and sector edit mode (pops up the edit->line or edit->sector menus. Right click by default)
    -> Middle click to snap to the nearest vertex in line draw mode
    -> Mouse wheel is now configurable and usable for 3d mode controls

So go to the downloads section and download, for great justice and whatnot. Oh yeah, and you'll have to either delete slade.cfg or select 'restore defaults' in the edit->preferences->input dialog, because of some input system changes from GTK to wxWidgets. Otherwise most input controls won't work at all :P
