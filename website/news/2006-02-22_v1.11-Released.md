SLADE v1.11 is now available at the downloads section. I didn't get around to doing everything I wanted for this version, but it has some important changes that really couldn't wait. Here's a full list:

    -> Line and sector specials are now shown on their respective edit dialogs
    -> Thing and line flags are now defined in game configurations instead of being hardcoded
    -> Page Up/Down keys now work in the texture browser
    -> Greatly reduced loading time, textures are no longer all loaded at startup
    -> Tab and Return keys now work in the input preferences dialog
    -> Simple 'create sector' function (doesn't work in all situations though)
    -> Hexen-format line and thing information is shown on the infobar (args etc)
    -> 'Light gradient' function
    -> Added ability to set a 'background texture' in 2d mode, useful for aligning map architecture to flat textures
    -> Thing args are now saved properly when changed
    -> Added back the 'Checks' menu
    -> Reimplemented support for HIRESTEX textures (defines and remaps)
    -> Bugfixes

Also, there is a new SLADE svn available here on mancubus.net: <A HREF="http://slade.mancubus.net/svn">http://slade.mancubus.net/svn</A>. So yeah, if you want all the latest updates, compile the source from there ;)
