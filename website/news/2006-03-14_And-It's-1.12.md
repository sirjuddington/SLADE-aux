New SLADE version, 1.12. Here's the changes:

    -> 'Import Map' feature
    -> Grid level now shown on the status bar
    -> Rotate feature
    -> Affected line lengths are shown while moving vertices/lines/sectors
    -> X/Y Axis mirroring (map architecture and things)
    -> 'Run map' option (configurable)
    -> Node builder paths are now configurable (plus added bsp as a nodebuilder)
    -> Improved context menus
    -> Changed rectangle draw to 'shape draw'. A drawing options sidebar is now available to select the type of shape to draw, and options for that shape
    -> New 'Theme' sidebar, to select default textures/properties for new sectors
    -> Line drawing controls are now configurable
    -> Added new controls 'edit_createitem2', '3d_reset_xoffset' and '3d_reset_yoffset' (check the online documentation for details)
    -> Also added controls to copy/paste offsets in 3d mode
    -> View related controls now work while line/shape drawing
    -> 'Paint room' for 3d mode now works on flats (paints adjacent flats of the same height)
    -> Bugfixes and random improvements

Also you may notice I've put up the beginnings of some SLADE documentation. There isn't much there yet, but I'll add to it gradually (and anyone can feel free to write some for me, too :P).
