Bit of a break there, but whatever, here's 1.13:

     -> 'Hide IWAD Textures' option in texture browser
     -> DECORATE things are now parsed (scaling and transparency also supported)
     -> Many improvements to the ACS editor, including hilighting and autocomplete
     -> Map panning (shift+right click by default)
     -> Various bugfixes and (slight) performance improvements
