Whee, so it's about time I properly released some version of 2.0. In case you didn't know, 2.0 is a near-complete rewrite of SLADE (yet again :P), with many improvements over the 1.x series. Well it's not entirely finished, but close enough for a beta release ;) Here's what's new and also what's missing:

     -> Near complete rewrite
     -> Major rework of the internal map handling and a bunch of other stuff
     -> New default colour scheme, changed the way colour schemes work too
     -> PK3/Zip format support
     -> ZDBSP now built-in as the gl-node builder and default nodebuilder
     -> Greatly improved line/shape drawing
        (it's now possible to draw 'over' existing lines)
     -> Multiple bindings for controls now possible
     -> No more 'setting up' 3d mode (except for building gl nodes), so it should start up much faster
     -> Basic sky preview in 3d mode
     -> Much improved 2d editor speed
     -> Moved resources to slade.pk3 (instead of 'res' and 'games' folders)
     -> 'Hide Unused Textures' option in the texture browser
     -> Added some useful console commands (see console.txt)
     -> Configuration is now saved in the user's home directory rather than the SLADE application directory
     -> Hopefully much more stable than 1.x ;)
    
    MISSING FROM PREVIOUS (will come in later 2.0 betas / 2.0 final):
     -> 3d Mode slopes
     -> Fancy script editor with hilighting etc
     -> Few more things I'm sure

Whew so that's it. Head over to the downloads section to grab it, as per usual.
