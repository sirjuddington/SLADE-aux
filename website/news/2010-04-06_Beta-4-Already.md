Well a lot sooner than I planned, here's beta 4. I would have waited longer to up the version but beta 3 had some nasty problems. So, here's what's new:

- The usual bug fixes and improvements
- Added "Convert to ANIMDEFS" function to context menu when ANIMATED and/or SWITCHES lumps are selected
- TGA and TIFF support
- Added new cvar gl_tex_enable_np2 which will completely disable non-power-of-two textures if set to false (set it in slade3.cfg)
- Fixed problem where saving an archive took much too long
- Added support for viewing BMF fonts
- Colormaps and translation tables can now be viewed (temporary, i plan to get a full colormap editor/previewer going eventually)
- Can now open embedded zips
- Several new text types recognised

Barring any real problems I'm hoping to have the TEXTUREx editor mostly complete by the next beta release :)
