Well the SLADE website has been down for a week or so, during that time a few things have happened.

Gez has setup an SVN builds page over at [DRD Team](http://svn.drdteam.org/slade/). So if you're feeling adventurous, try out the latest (win32) SVN build of SLADE while waiting on the next proper beta version :)

I've also setup a Wiki for SLADE over here, which will be added to over time with documentation, tutorials, information etc etc.

That's all for now, hopefully within the next few weeks I'll get beta6 up, if all goes well...
