With beta 7, SLADE 3 now has all the features of SLumpEd (and more of course). This means that I won't be adding any new major features for v3.0. Before the final 3.0 release, though, I'd like to get it as bug free as possible, so I encourage people to test beta 7 as much as they can, and report any bugs or annoyances via either the forums (preferrably), email or on the wiki.

Hopefully I can get the final 3.0 out before the end of the year :)
