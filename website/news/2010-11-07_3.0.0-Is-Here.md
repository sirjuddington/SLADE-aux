With all the features (and more) of SLumpEd, and (hopefully) all the bugs from beta gone, it's finally time - for SLADE v3.0.0 :) Go grab it at the downloads page!

The only real new feature added since beta7 is an 'Export to PNG' function for gfx entries, to alleviate the hassle of having to convert manually before exporting. Apart from that, many bugs were fixed and various interface-related oddities were fixed up, and the entry type detection code was optimised significantly.

To coincide with the release, the old SLADE/SLumpEd forums have been cleared, and in their place is a new SLADE3 set of forums. Feel free to post any bug reports, feature requests, or anything else SLADE-related there.
