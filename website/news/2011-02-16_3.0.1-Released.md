A bit later than I would have liked, here is SLADE v3.0.1. It's for the most part a bugfix/improvements release after 3.0.0, but there are a few new things in there too. Below is a list of the major changes and additions in this version:

> - Support for more game formats: Wolf3D/SoD, Dark Forces, Descent, Unreal/Half-Life WAD3, Half-Life texture, Quake2 wal
> - Fixed many problems with the texture editor
> - New 'Save Map Image' button on map preview
> - The archive menu now has its own associated toolbar
> - Swapped the top and bottom bars of controls in the entry viewers (mostly to get the 'save changes' button to a more convenient location)
> - Entry names containing / or \ are now valid in wad archives
> - Added the ability to drag files onto the program window: dropping files on the entry list will import them to the archive, dropping them anywhere else will attempt to open them as archives
> - Many general bugfixes and small improvements

The map editor is coming along slowly but surely, hopefully it'll be done before the end of the year at the latest...
