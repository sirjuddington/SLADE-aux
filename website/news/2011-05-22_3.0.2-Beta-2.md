Well the last few things I wanted to do for 3.0.2 are now done, and therefore 3.0.2 beta2 is now up at the downloads page. Now all it needs is some polish and bugfixing before 3.0.2 final :)

All that's really new since beta 1 is the ability to use textures as patches for ZDoom TEXTURES, and the ability to copy and paste textures from one list to another, patches and all.
