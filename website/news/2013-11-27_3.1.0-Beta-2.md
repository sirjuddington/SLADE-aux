SLADE 3.1.0 beta 2 is up, with numerous changes since beta 1. For more information and a full list of changes, head over to the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/releases/tag/3.1.0_b2). You can also download the windows binaries and sources from there, or as usual from the downloads section here.

Work on SLADE has been increasing in pace lately, and I'm hoping to continue this trend and get another beta out reasonably soon. Might even end up with 3.1.0 final before the end of the year if all goes well...
