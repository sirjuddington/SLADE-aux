And it's the third beta for 3.1.0. There have been a huge number of changes since beta 2, and for the most part everything I wanted to get in for 3.1.0 is done. As such, this will likely be the last beta before the final release, and until then the focus will mostly be on bug fixing and polishing.

For an overview of changes since beta 2, check the GitHub release page [here](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/releases/tag/3.1.0_b3).
