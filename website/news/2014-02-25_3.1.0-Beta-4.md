Another month, another beta. I know 3 was meant to be the last, but there have been very many changes and fixes since then and I still don't feel that everything is stable and complete enough for a final release. Since it has been over a month since the last beta, I figured it's about time to get another release out.

The map editor in particular should be a lot more stable now, and hopefully will no longer have problems with sector references on merging and issues with undo/redo.

Who knows how many betas it will take, but I would like for the final release to be as stable as possible, and as long as the bug reports keep coming in, the longer the final release will be delayed - but hopefully will be much better for it.
