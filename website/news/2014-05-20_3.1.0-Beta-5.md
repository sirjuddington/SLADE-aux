And we're up to beta 5 now. It's available from the downloads section and at the GitHub release [page](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/releases/tag/3.1.0_b5). Changes since beta 4 can also be found there.

The good news is, bug reports have been slowing a lot since beta 4, so it's looking like this will be the last beta before I can finally release 3.1.0. It's been a very long time coming, but shouldn't be much longer now...
