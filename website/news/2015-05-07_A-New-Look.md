As you can probably see, the SLADE website has had a bit of a facelift - less rounded edges! softer colours! fancy animations!

For the most part the changes are to the style, with the general layout remaining pretty much the same. The next SLADE release will most likely have an updated start page to match.

As for SLADE development progress, things have been pretty slow recently. Hopefully this will change soon but we'll see. I've earmarked a few more issues on GitHub to address before the next minor release (3.1.0.2), which will most likely be the last minor release before 3.1.1. I hope to have it ready soon, and then 3.1.1 some time later this year.
