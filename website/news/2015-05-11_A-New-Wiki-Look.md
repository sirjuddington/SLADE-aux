In addition to the website visual overhaul detailed last post, the [SLADE wiki](http://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=wiki) is now also available directly from the website, styled to match with the rest of the site. The wiki itself is still hosted on GitHub and must be edited there.

In an upcoming release of SLADE the wiki will be available directly within the program (Help &rarr; Online Documentation), opened as a tab, as long as there is an active internet connection and wxWebView support is enabled (which is the default in Windows and OSX).
