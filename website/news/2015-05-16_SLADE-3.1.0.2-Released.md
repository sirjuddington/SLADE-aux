A new minor update to SLADE has been released, which fixes a variety of issues and comes with some minor improvements. Hopefully this will be the last minor release before 3.1.1, unless any nasty bugs show up.

For more information about the changes, see the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/releases/tag/3.1.0.2).
