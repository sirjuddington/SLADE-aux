As promised last post, the first beta build of SLADE 3.1.1 is released. There are a few major new features in this release, including slopes support in 3d mode, entry list sorting, a generic data view for various entry types, and more. For a full list of changes, as per usual they can be found on the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/releases/tag/3.1.1_b1).

One feature that some may notice is missing, if they have been using the builds from DRDTeam, is the advanced music/audio panel. This feature will be added (back) in a future beta release of 3.1.1.

So head over to the downloads page and try out the beta, if you are so inclined.
