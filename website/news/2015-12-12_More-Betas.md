The second beta release of 3.1.1 is up, with a bunch of improvements and fixes over the last one. The enhanced music/audio playback stuff is back from older drd builds as well.

As per usual, check the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/releases/tag/3.1.1_b2) for more details on what has changed since beta 1.

The last thing I'm planning for 3.1.1 is undo/redo in the texture editor (which is mostly done), once that is in it'll just be a matter of more testing and bug fixes before 3.1.1 final is released, which should hopefully be early next year.
