And it's time for the official release of SLADE v3.1.1. For a full list of changes since 3.1.0.5 see [here](http://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=changes&v=3.1.1). The most notable new features are slopes support in the map editor 3d mode, entry list sorting, and a new grid view/editor for various data entry types.

Some work on 3.1.2 is already underway, including the ability to open entries in external editors (eg. graphics in paint), so look forward to that in the first beta of 3.1.2, whenever that is.
