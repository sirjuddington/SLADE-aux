Hot on the heels of 3.1.1 comes 3.1.1.1, with quite a few bug fixes, including some especially major ones - SLADE can actually open maps with slopes in them without crashing now (oops). The release also hopefully resolves some long standing issues with saving zip files and entry data becoming messed up, among various other things which can be viewed [here](http://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=changes&v=3.1.1.1).

In other news, 3.1.2 is still coming along, recently I've been looking at some improvements to the text editor, like [code folding](http://slade.mancubus.net/shots/dev/codefold.png), an improved [find+replace](http://slade.mancubus.net/shots/dev/findreplace.png) bar and some better [customisation options](http://slade.mancubus.net/shots/dev/styleprefs.png) like the ability to set a global default font for the text editor. Also, eevee has began to make some progress implementing 3d floors preview in 3d mode, which is also planned for 3.1.2.
