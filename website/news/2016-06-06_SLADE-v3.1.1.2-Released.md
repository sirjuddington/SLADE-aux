A new version of SLADE is up with a bunch of fixes over 3.1.1.1, which can be seen [here](http://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=changes&v=3.1.1.2). I wasn't planning on releasing this just yet, but Microsoft decided to move the visual studio runtimes download location which broke the installer. The installer for this version should work properly again, as I've changed it to download the runtimes from the SLADE website, rather than Microsoft.
